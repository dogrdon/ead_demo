I have EADs and I want to index, solr ead quickstart:

1) get blackllight set up
2) test if everything works* 
3) add solr_ead
4) add dynamic fields to your solr schema
5) move solr_ead.rake file locally if you are having the error "don't know how to build..."
6) test indexing
7) check in browser...it will sort of work, but we need to make sure the solr config and the blacklight config are working properly:
	a) index seems to be off
	b) display of records available seems to be off
	
	
	
*if complains about nokogiri being 10 but expecting 11, run gem pristine nokogiri
