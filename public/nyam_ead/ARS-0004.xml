<head>Historical Note</head> 
	<p>The Society for the Advancement of Clinical Study formed in 1912 and established the Bureau of Clinical Information, held at the New York Academy of Medicine. The Society's purpose was "to make available to visiting and local Physicians and Surgeons the clinical resources of the city." Its activities included publishing booklets listing hospitals and fixed clinics open to visitors and posting a daily bulletin of medical clinics. In 1924, the Society's functions were assumed by the Committee of Medical Education at the New York Academy of Medicine.</p>
