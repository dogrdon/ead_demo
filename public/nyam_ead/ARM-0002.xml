		<head>Historical Note</head> 
		<p>In 1898 the 5 independent municipalities making up the growing metropolitan area were consolidated into the City of Greater New York of 5 boroughs under a central government. These formerly independent boroughs had their own medical associations.  This new association was to provide a parallel central professional agency.</p><p>At the first meeting of the Association on April 12, 1899 "Dr. McLeod ... spoke of the great desirability of having an Association which should properly represent the medical profession of the entire consolidated city."  By-laws stated "the object of this organization is to bring together in Association members of the Profession of Medicine residing in the various boroughs of the City of New York..."</p><p>Austin Flint presided over the first meeting.  The temporary chair was Dr. S.B.W. McLeod.  The recording secretary was P. Brynberg Proter. Papers were presented at the meetings. The association voted to disband at a meeting on October 16, 1936.</p>
