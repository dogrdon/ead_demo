		<head>Historical Note</head> 
		<p>The American Legion Caduceus Post originated in 1919 as the Medical Department Post of New York. Meetings were held at various clubs in New York, including the Academy of Medicine. In 1920, the Medical Department Post of New York and the Harry D. Gill Post amalgamated and the nominative "Caduceus Post" was adopted. By 1921 the Post had a membership of over four hundred former medical officers of the Army and Navy. The purpose of the association was to assemble members of the Medical, Sanitary, Dental, and Veterinary Corps around issues of interest to military, veteran and civil society. Advocacy for state and federal legislation in favor of veterans was a primary objective, along with improvement in public education toward greater support of military and veteran's affairs. Formation of a Ladies Auxiliary of the Post began in 1922.</p>
