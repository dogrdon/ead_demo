		<head>Historical Note</head> 
		<p> The New York Neurological Society was founded in 1872. Two years later, several members called for a reorganization saying that the Society  "beyond the transaction of some business of minor importance...had thus far never accomplished anything."  The revived society was for the "study of clinical cases and pathological specimens, leaving to our sister society [The New York Society of Neurology and Electrology] the discussions of papers of a heavy and theoretical character." The Society was incorporated in 1882.</p>

		<p>Early on, the Society became active in political areas.  Among its first causes were lobbying against a proposed law to prohibit medical experimentation on animals and concern for abuses in the management of the city's insane asylum.</p>
<p>The society often had joint meetings with the New York Academy of Medicine's Section on Neurology and Psychiatry.  To reduce the number of meetings members had to attend each year, in 1931 it was proposed to hold all meetings jointly with the Academy's section.</p>

		<head>Scope and Content</head> 
		<p>This small collection is largely the minutes of the Society. The minutes are fairly sparse; details of presentations and discussions are lacking beyond the names of the presenter and those that participated in the discussion. The membership records are extensive, and the minutes of the Executive Council are almost entirely about membership.</p>
