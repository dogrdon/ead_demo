		<head>Historical Statement</head>
	<p>Dr. William J. Morton (1846-1920) was the son of Dr. William T.G. Morton, who is largely credited with the first successful demonstration of ether anesthesia in 1846. Dr. Morton was a neurologist in New York, and a member of the New York Academy of Medicine. He was particularly interested in the developing field of radiology, and co-authored the book "X-ray; or Photography of the invisible and its value in surgery" with Edwin W. Hammer in 1896. His research in the field was widely covered by both national newspapers and scientific journals. </p>

		<head>Scope and Content</head> 
		<p>The collection is comprised of scrapbooks of newspaper clippings; a photo album of cancer patients; correspondence; reprints of his published journal articles; and contact lists. The majority of the scrapbooks contain newspaper articles documenting his work with X-rays and the use of trypsin, of which he was a strong proponent, as a cure for cancer. The scrapbooks also contain various other articles relating to Dr. Morton, or that he found of interest, including several on the protection of dogs from vivisection.
The articles are taken from local New York newspapers (<title render="italic">New York Herald</title>, <title render="italic">New York Tribune</title>, <title render="italic">New York World</title>), national newspapers (<title render="italic">Commercial Gazette</title>, <title render="italic">San Francisco Examiner</title>), and national medical and scientific journals (<title render="italic">Electrical Journal</title>, <title render="italic">Scientific American</title>, <title render="italic">New York Medical Journal</title>). </p>
