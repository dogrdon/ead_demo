		<p>Charles Henry May was a New York ophthamologist. He recieved his medical degree from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University in 1883. He later studied in Europe, specializing in ophthamology and otology. He was on the staff of many New York hospitals and clinics, and he founded the ophthalmological department at Belleveue Hospital in 1914 and served as its director until 1925. Additionally, he maintained a large private practice, developed opthalmological instruments, and contributed to textbooks, reference works, and periodicals.</p>
